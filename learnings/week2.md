- `main.go` is mostly the dependency injector
- Go has Value Types and Reference Types. 
    - Basic types like int, float, bool, arrays are all Value types by default. i.e we get complete copies.
    - slices, maps, and channels are Reference types by default. i.e we get copy of the internal pointer (reference) so multiple variable can refer to same underlying data.
        - in a slice the variable do not hold array data instead a small "header" with pointer, len and cap, this reduces memory overhead while passing stuff.
        - you can initialize a slice by not providing an array size and just type. Array - := [3]int{1,2,3} Slice - := []int{1,2,3}
        - changes to a copy of a slice affects parent. to do this in array pass as pointer duh!
        - a slice created from an array would affect the parent array but not vice versa.
- no `while` or `do-while` only `for` loop, thank god
- There is no ORMs in Golang unlike the JS world as Golangians (?) believe in rawdogging SQL. 
    - As a middle ground we can use `sqlc` package which generates type-safe GO methods based on raw SQl queries in `.sql` files.
- For DB migrations `golang-migrate/migrate` is used.
- When installing packages using `go install` `-tags` such as sqlite are important to compile the tool with neccessary driver support.
    - Ex: `go install -tags 'sqlite' github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/cmd/migrate@latest` here -tags used to install with sqlite driver.
- `migrate create -ext sql -dir db/migrations -seq init_schema` to create migration using migrate package.
    - `-ext sql` for writing plain SQL files.
    - `-dir` directory obv
    - `-seq` sequential number and name for versioning migrations
- Go doesn't have constant, statically-typed structs to hold values like a collection of constants. `const` is reserved for simple, primitive types like int, bool and string.
    - Work around is to define a **Blueprint**: Creating a struct that describes the collection
    - And then create an instance to populate a single, package-level `var`.
    - Go's philosophy is to group code by `domain` or `responsibility`, so a constant is part of the package it describes.
