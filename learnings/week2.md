- `main.go` is mostly the dependency injector
- Go has Value Types and Reference Types. 
    - Basic types like int, float, bool, arrays are all Value types by default. i.e we get complete copies.
    - slices, maps, and channels are Reference types by default. i.e we get copy of the internal pointer (reference) so multiple variable can refer to same underlying data.
        - in a slice the variable do not hold array data instead a small "header" with pointer, len and cap, this reduces memory overhead while passing stuff.
        - you can initialize a slice by not providing an array size and just type. Array - := [3]int{1,2,3} Slice - := []int{1,2,3}
        - changes to a copy of a slice affects parent. to do this in array pass as pointer duh!
        - a slice created from an array would affect the parent array but not vice versa.
- no `while` or `do-while` only `for` loop, thank god
